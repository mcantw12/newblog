A histogram measures two attributes next to eachother in a very visual format. By storing our SQL query as 'result' we can use that as the data for our ggplot. Specifying 'histogram' after 'geom_' defines this as a scatterplot. The title is added with the command 'ggtitle'.

```{r warning=FALSE}
query<-"SELECT weight FROM Master"
result<-sqldf(query)
ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(data=result, aes(x=weight), color='white', fill='black', bins=50)+
  ggtitle("Body Weight Distribution")
```
