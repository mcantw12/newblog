Any attribute being compared to a timeline is called a time-series graph. Here we used the 'point' specification along with 'line' to ensure that both points and lines are marked. We also labeled the axis with 'xlab' and 'ylab'

```{r}
query<-"SELECT yearID, HR FROM Batting WHERE playerID='ruthba01'"
result<-sqldf(query)
ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result, aes(x=yearID, y=HR))+
  geom_line(data=result, aes(x=yearID, y=HR))+
  ggtitle("Ruth Homeruns by Year")+
  xlab("Home Runs")+
  ylab("Year")
```
