A scatterplot graphs a point based on two attributes. These types of graphs are very useful for large amounts of data.


```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,sum(HR) AS career_HR,sum(SO) AS career_SO
FROM Batting
GROUP BY playerID
HAVING sum(HR)>=400"
sqldf(query)
result<-sqldf(query)
ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=career_SO,y=career_HR),size=3,color="blue")+
  ggtitle("Career Strikeouts and Homeruns")+
  xlab("Strikeouts")+
  ylab("Homeruns")
```
